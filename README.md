# Hand Gesture Control using MediaPipe

This Python project utilizes the [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) library and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to perform real-time hand gesture recognition. With this code, you can control your computer's cursor using hand gestures within a defined control box.

## Features

- Detects and tracks hand landmarks in real time
- Controls mouse cursor movement with smooth tracking
- Provides a visual control box for easier interaction
- Configurable sensitivity and smoothing parameters
- Low CPU usage and responsive performance

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.11 (MediaPipe is not compatible with Python 3.13)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pip install pyautogui`)

You can install all dependencies at once using:

```bash
py -3.11 -m pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yadavnikhil17102004/Gesture-Controll-hehe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Gesture-Controll-hehe
   ```

3. Run the code with Python 3.11:

   ```bash
   py -3.11 main.py
   ```

4. A window titled "Hand Mouse Control" will open showing your webcam feed with a green control box.
   - Move your index finger within the control box to control the mouse cursor
   - The control box maps to your entire screen for precise control
   - Movement is smoothed for better usability

5. To exit the program, press 'q' in the OpenCV window.

## Customization Options

You can easily customize the program by modifying these parameters in the code:

- `GAP` (default: 100): Controls the margin from the edges of the camera frame
- `SMOOTHING` (default: 5): Higher values create smoother but slower cursor movement
- `min_detection_confidence` (default: 0.7): Adjust sensitivity of hand detection

## How It Works

1. The program captures video from your webcam
2. A control box is defined within the frame with margins set by the `GAP` parameter
3. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks, particularly the index finger tip
4. When your index finger is within the control box:
   - Its position is mapped to your screen coordinates
   - Movement is smoothed using a weighted average algorithm
   - The cursor is moved to the calculated position

## Troubleshooting

- **Camera not detected**: Make sure your webcam is properly connected and not being used by another application
- **Jerky cursor movement**: Increase the `SMOOTHING` value for smoother movement
- **Hand not detected**: Ensure proper lighting and increase the camera resolution if available
